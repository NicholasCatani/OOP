_**Polyglots**_

Each student at a school speaks a number of languages. We need to determine which languages are spoken by all the students, and which languages are spoken by at least one student.
Details:
First line contains a natural number representing a number of students N in the school
Second line contains a natural number L representing how many languages the first students speaks
The following L lines indicate the languages spoken by the first student, one per line
Next line contains a natural number L representing how many languages the second students speaks
The following L lines indicate the languages spoken by the second student, one per line
And so on until the information was provided for all N students
Print the number of languages spoken by all the students, followed by a list the languages in alphabetical order, 
then print the number of languages spoken by at least one student, followed by the list of the languages, in alphabetical order.


Example

Input:
3 
3 
Russian 
English 
Japanese 
2 
Russian 
English 
1 
English


Output:
1 
English 
3 
English 
Japanese 
Russian


_Python Code:_

N = int(input())
all_languages = set(input().strip() for _ in range(int(input())))
any_languages = set(all_languages)

for _ in range(N - 1):
    student_languages = set(input().strip() for _ in range(int(input())))
    all_languages &= student_languages
    any_languages |= student_languages

print(len(all_languages))
print("\n".join(sorted(all_languages)))
print(len(any_languages))
print("\n".join(sorted(any_languages)))
