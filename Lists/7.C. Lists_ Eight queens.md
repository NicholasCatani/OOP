# Statement
### It is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, it requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.  

### Given a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard. If there is a pair of queens that violates this rule, print YES, otherwise print NO. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, with each pair giving the position of a queen on a standard chessboard with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 8.

```
Example input
1 5
2 3
3 1
4 7
5 2
6 8
7 6
8 4
(shown on the picture)

Example output
NO
```


# Python Code:
```

coords = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(8)]
x_co, y_co = zip(*coords)

## Checking for duplicate x or y coordinates
if len(set(x_co)) < 8 or len(set(y_co)) < 8:
    print("YES")
else:
    ## Checking for diagonal conflicts
    rule_violation = any(abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 -y2) for i, (x1, y1) in enumerate(coords) for x2, y2 in coords[i+1:])
    print("YES" if rule_violation else "NO")

```
